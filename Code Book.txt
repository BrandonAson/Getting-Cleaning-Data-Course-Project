The run_analysis.R script creates an independent tidy data set containing the average of each variable for each activity and each subject from the original data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.  A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained: 

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

The following is a link to the data used for the project:

Experimental Design
_____________________

The R script run_analysis.R downloads the data from the link listed above, unzips the data set and creates the following folder in the local directory (./UCI HAR Dataset).

The run_analysis script then loads the test and training data sets as well as the features and activity labels.

The run_analysis script subsequently merges the test and training datasets, adds a descriptive name to each variable that comes from the features file, and selects only the variables containing mean or standard deviation values.  

The activity and subject id variables are then added as two new variables labeled as ‘activity’ and ‘subject’ respectively.  

A new data set is then created containing the mean of each variable for each activity and each subject.  

This is then output as a text file to the local directory with the file name tidyDataSet.txt.

subject: The subject variable lists the number that identifies each individual subject (1-30).

activity: The activity variable lists the six different activities that were measured: laying, sitting, standing, walking, walking_downstairs, and walking_upstairs.

The additional variables selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. 

These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAccMag (standard gravity units ‘g’)
tGravityAccMag (standard gravity units ‘g’)
tBodyAccJerkMag (seconds)
tBodyGyroMag (radians/second)
tBodyGyroJerkMag (radians/second)
fBodyAcc-XYZ (Hz)
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ (Hz)
fBodyGyro-XYZ (Hz)
fBodyAccMag (Hz)
fBodyAccJerkMag (Hz)
fBodyGyroMag (Hz)
fBodyGyroJerkMag (Hz)

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean: Mean value
std: Standard deviation
meanFreq: Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean (standard gravity units ‘g’)
tBodyAccMean (standard gravity units ‘g’)
tBodyAccJerkMean (standard gravity units ‘g’)
tBodyGyroMean (radians/second)
tBodyGyroJerkMean (radians/second)
